Standard perturbation method along with the application of inverse Fourier sine transform technique is used to obtain the first order correction to the velocity potential that involves an unknown function. The correction to the velocity potential is also found by considering two special shapes of the bended plate.},

The solver is implemented for waves on variable currents and arbitrary depths following the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) approximation. The ray tracing module is implemented in a class structure, and the output is verified against analytical solutions and tested for numerical convergence. The solver is accompanied by a set of ancillary functions such as retrieval of ambient conditions using OPeNDAP, transformation of geographical coordinates, and structuring of data using community standards.

  abstract = {The boundary element method (BEM) in the context of acoustics or Helmholtz problems is reviewed in this paper. The basis of the BEM is initially developed for Laplace’s equation. The boundary integral equation formulations for the standard interior and exterior acoustic problems are stated and the boundary element methods are derived through collocation. It is shown how interior modal analysis can be carried out via the boundary element method. Further extensions in the BEM in acoustics are also reviewed, including half-space problems and modelling the acoustic field surrounding thin screens. Current research in linking the boundary element method to other methods in order to solve coupled vibro-acoustic and aero-acoustic problems and methods for solving inverse problems via the BEM are surveyed. Applications of the BEM in each area of acoustics are referenced. The computational complexity of the problem is considered and methods for improving its general efficiency are reviewed. The significant maintenance issues of the standard exterior acoustic solution are considered, in particular the weighting parameter in combined formulations such as Burton and Miller’s equation. The commonality of the integral operators across formulations and hence the potential for development of a software library approach is emphasised.},

Analytical expressions for the first-order corrections to the reflection and transmission coefficients are derived in terms of integrals involving the shape functions describing the two sides of the slender barrier. A relatively straightforward perturbation technique is used along with the application of Green’s theorem in the fluid region. Corresponding analytical expressions representing the reflection and transmission coefficients are also deduced, (i) for a nearly vertical barrier and (ii) for a vertically symmetric slender barrier, as special cases for both the problems. For a nearly vertical barrier it is observed, analytically, that there is no first-order correction to the transmitted wave at any frequency. Computations for the reflection and transmission coefficients up to O("), where " is a small nondimensional number, are also performed and presented here.},

To get the energy-dissipation, reflection, transmission, and diffraction of solitary waves to porous structures, we use Lee et al.’s (2014) model. They developed extended Boussinesq equations for waves in porous media considering inertial and drag resistances. When these resistances are neglected, the model is reduced to the extended Boussinesq equations of Madsen and Sørensen (1992). For the initial condition we use an analytical solution of solitary waves for Madsen and Sørensen’s (1992) Boussinesq equations. For verification, numerical results of Lee et al.’s (2014) model are compared to the numerical and experimental results of Lara et al. (2012) in a case of solitary waves normally incident to a semi-infinite porous breakwater. Numerical simulations are conducted for various cases such as obliquely incident solitary waves to a semi-infinite porous breakwater, solitary waves to a detached porous breakwater or through a porous breakwater gap.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a new open-source implementation of the lower-order, 3-D Boundary Element Method (BEM) of solution to the deep-water, zero Froude-number wave-body interaction problem is described. A validation case for OMHyD, the new open-source package, is included, where the outputs are compared to results obtained using the widely used frequency-domain hydrodynamic analysis package ANSYS-AQWA. The theory behind the solution to the diffraction-radiation problem is re-visited using the Green function method. The Hess and Smith panel method is then extended to the case of a floating object using the image-source to impose the wall condition at the free-surface, and a wavy Green function component to account for presence of free-surface waves. An algorithm for computer implementation of the procedure is developed and subsequently implemented in PYTHON. The wavy part of the Green function is determined using a verified and published FORTRAN code by Teleste and Noblesse, wrapped for PYTHON using the Fortran to Python (F2PY) interface. Results are presented for the various stages of implementation viz. panelling, body in infinite fluid domain, effect of the free-surface, and effect of surface-waves. The hydrodynamic coefficients obtained from this preliminary frequency-domain analysis are shown to be in satisfactory agreement with ANSYS-AQWA results. Conclusions are drawn based on the performance of the code, followed by suggestions for further improvement by including the removal of irregular-frequencies, multi-body interactions, and bottom interference, which are not considered in the present implementation.},
